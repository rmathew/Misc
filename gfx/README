ranjit.xcf
----------
The GIMP file used to create the "Ranjit Logo" in Devanagari.

console8x16.bdf
---------------
The BDF source for the OldSkool "console8x16" bitmapped font from Konsole (in
KDE 3.5.x) as created/compiled by Lars Doelle. I *love* this font due to its
near-perfect glyphs at low-resolutions (IMO) and my nostalgia for old IBM PCs.

Use "bdftopcf" to compile the BDF source to a PCF font for X11:

  bdftopcf -t -o console8x16.pcf console8x16.bdf && gzip --best console8x16.pcf

Copy this over to an X11 fonts-directory (e.g. "/usr/lib/X11/fonts/misc") and
then run "mkfontdir" as root on that directory.

The original file can be found in the "kdebase-3.5.10" sources:

  https://download.kde.org/Attic/3.5.10/src/kdebase-3.5.10.tar.bz2

as "kdebase-3.5.10/konsole/fonts/console8x16.bdf".

The Trinity Desktop Environment (TDE) preserves a copy of this file from KDE
3.5.x here:

  https://git.trinitydesktop.org/cgit/tdebase/tree/konsole/fonts/console8x16.bdf

The source-file should have the MD5-checksum "b961b8a1f45973c637a36542db632b29"
everywhere.

mconsole8x16.bdf
----------------
A variant of "console8x16" above with some box-drawing characters:

  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box-drawing_character#Unix,_CP/M,_BBS

patched in at the places in the DEC VT100 Alternate Character Set (ACS):

  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DEC_Special_Graphics

where mrxvt (sadly) expects them to be. Note that "console8x16" *does* have
these characters, just not at the code-point `ascii_code - 0x5F` in the font
where mrxvt expects to find them. On the other hand, xterm and Konsole use a
fall-back mechanism for locating these box-drawing characters that works
correctly with "console8x16".
