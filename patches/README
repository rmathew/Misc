This directory contains a few patches to make legacy software work on
a modern Linux system. See the individual patches for more details.

nvidia_96xx_legacy_kernel-3.19.8.patch
--------------------------------------
This patch makes the Linux kernel-module from the "legacy" Nvidia 96.43.23
driver for 32-bit Linux work with Linux kernel 3.19.8.

xmbdfed-4.7-linux.patch
-----------------------
This patch makes the XmBDFEditor 4.7 sources compile under a modern Linux
system. You can then use the application to create or edit bitmapped graphics
fonts in the BDF file-format.
