You will need a C compiler that supports the C99 standard.

If you have CMake (https://cmake.org), you can use something like the
following to build this program using your favorite build-tool (Make, Ninja,
etc.):

    cmake -S . -B build
    cmake --build build
    cmake --install build --prefix=/foo/bar

Alternatively, you can use a POSIX-compliant Make tool to build this:

    make
    make PREFIX=/foo/bar install

after updating the config.mk file, if needed.
