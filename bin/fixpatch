# This script adjusts cvs diffs so that the old and new filenames are
# identical to the Index entry.  It's useful when the CVS server
# outputs only the basename of the file in there, since `patch' gives
# precedence to these fields, instead of Index, so it ends up applying
# patches in the wrong file.  This shouldn't be needed for recent CVS
# servers, that already include pathname in diffs, but there shouldn't
# be a problem in running it unconditionally.

# If no files are specified in the command line, fixpatch reads from
# the standard input.  In all cases, the fixed patch files go to the
# standard output.

# usage: fixpatch [-h] [-v] [file ...]

# -v      --version     print version information
# -h,-?   --help        print short or long help message
